# Odin Project: Etch-A-Sketch

This is part of the **Odin Project**.

*This showcases a basic online drawing tool using **JavaScript**, **HTML**, and **CSS**.*

## Skills Learned

- More complex event listeners
- Improved code reusability
- CSS manipulation with JavaScript
- Version control with Git Branches

## Reflection

I had a pleasant experience creating the drawing pad with the limited amount of skills I have learned so far. One of the more problematic bugs that I encountered was when I implemented different colors with the drawing pad instead of a monochromatic pen; the canvas would either not change colors or would disappear entirely - these issues were caused by overlapping event handlers. I admit that I did not put much effort into the styling of the webpage mostly since I do not find it to be as satisfying nor interesting as coding JavaScript. If I come back to this project, I will improve the UI to make it more appealing to the eyes as this current version looks like an early 2000s webpage.
